	<p>I’ve <a href="http://cforster.com/2015/06/markdown-skepticism/">griped before about markdown before</a>, and tried to imagine an alternative. I think there very well may be one, in a project I haven’t seen discussed much (particularly in DH-y, text-encoding-type circles): <a href="http://pollenpub.com">Pollen</a>.</p>
<p>There are projects—<a href="">great projects</a>—which are trying to use markdown for more purposes</p>
<p>And (for instance, use pandoc’s markdown and then use <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>s to create custom markup as necessary.)</p>
<p>Markdown is, almost inescapably, just a simplified HTML syntax. And so it inherits all its prejudices. (The most frustrating to writes of MLA-style essays, is the inability to nest a block quotation within a paragraph.)</p>
<p>And so Markdown competes with other simplified plaintext markup langauges: different flavors of markdown, asciidoc, reStructued text, and so on.</p>
<p>The richest markup option, however, is surely TEI.</p>
<p>Consider image formats. JPEG, PNG, and GIF vie for primacy on the web. (One could include PDF as a sort of image format… but I won’t.) And folks looking for high quality are likely to use TIFFs. I imagine among photographers and archivists there are heated arguments about image formats. But from a lay person’s perspective, it seems as if the varying formats don’t compete</p>
<p>In the end, all image formats must be presentable as a series of pixels and so, if nothing else, this provides a common denominator. If there is such a common denominator for text forms, it is probably plaintext—a series of characters.</p>
<p>Pollen is a markup language.</p>

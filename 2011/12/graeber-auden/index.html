	<p>During break, I’ve been enjoying reading David Graeber’s <em>Debt:
The First Five Thousand Years</em>. Graeber’s description of the
opposing logics of the market and the state recalled to my mind the
penultimate stanza of Auden’s <a
href="http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15545">“September 1,
1939”</a> that I couldn’t resist quickly noting it here.</p>
<p>Here is Graeber:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the great trap of the twentieth century: on the one side is
the logic of the market, where we like to imagine we all start out as
individuals who don’t owe each other anything. On the other is the logic
of the state, where we all begin with a debt we can never truly pay. We
are constantly told that they are opposites, and that tbetween them they
contain the only real human possibilities. But it’s a false dichotomy.
States created markets. Markets require states. Neither could continue
without the other, at least, in anything like the forms we would
recognize today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These two traps are what Auden will call the romantic lie and the lie
of authority; and what Graeber describes as the interdependence of the
market and the state is what Auden will call (and famously regret
calling) <em>love</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All I have is a voice<br /> To undo the folded lie,<br /> The
romantic lie in the brain<br /> Of the sensual man-in-the-street<br />
And the lie of Authority<br /> Whose buildings grope the sky:<br />
There is no such thing as the State<br /> And no one exists alone;<br />
Hunger allows no choice<br /> To the citizen or the police;<br /> We
must love one another or die.<br /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Recall these lines from Clement C. Moore’s “A Visit from Saint Nicholas,” (alternately titled “The Night Before Christmas” or “’Twas the Night Before Christmas”), first published in 1823. <span class="marginnote">See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Visit_from_St._Nicholas">wikipedia page</a> for some notes on contentions with regard to its authorship.</span></p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line-block">When what to my wondering eyes should appear,<br />
But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer…</div>
</div>
<p>But, exactly <em>how miniature</em> is this sleigh, and <em>how tiny</em> are these reindeer? While Moore’s poem did a lot to consolidate the mythology of Santa Claus, one thing that has <em>not</em> remained of Moore’s Saint Nicholas is his height. Recalling this insistence on the tinyness of Santa, much of the confusion around his movement through chimney flues is eliminated. But it also lends a different stress to the comparison of the elf’s nose to “like a cherry” or of his “little round belly” that shakes “like a bowl full of jelly.” At stake here is not simply nose complexion nor belly texture, but <em>size</em>.</p>
<p>If today our Santa is our bigger, it was not always so. And many earlier illustrations are consistent with Moore’s text. Consider these from a <a href="https://archive.org/stream/twasnightbeforec00moor">1912 edition</a> [archive.org] of the poem, by Jessie Wilcox Smith:</p>

<p>Likewise, look at this svelte Santa, by Arthur Rackham from <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/2027/miun.aek2825.0001.001">this undate edition</a> [HathiTrust], who is clearly small enough to easily slip down that chimney:</p>
